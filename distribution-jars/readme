ChalkProxy - manages test web servers

ChalkProxy solves the problem of keeping track of multiple test servers
which run on different machines and/or ports. 

Each server registers with ChalkProxy so that ChalkProxy can show
a list of all servers and ChalkProxy proxies for them so that the
URLs includes a meaningful name for the server you are using.

Features:
 -Supports IE7+, Chrome & Firefox 
 -Chalkboard page is self updating (you don't have to keep pressing refresh)
 -Servers can register arbitrary properties to include in the page
    (branch/release/user)
 -programmatic access to all servers is available at /list
 -/<serverName>/ proxies to the server
 
Requirements:
 -Java 6+
 -Linux (although writing a windows start script would probably be easy)

 Running:
  ./run -d start-stop    to run in demo mode
  ./run --help           to see options
  ./start                to run in background
  ./stop                 to stop
