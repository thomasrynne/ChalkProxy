ChalkProxy - a registry web servers

ChalkProxy solves the problem of keeping track of multiple web servers
which run on different machines and/or ports with different settings. 

Each server registers with ChalkProxy on startup and ChalkProxy 
provides a single page listing all the servers and their settings

Registation is achieved using a tcp connection. You send the registration
details as json and then keep the connection open. The registration
remains valid for as long as the connection is open.
A java client to simplify this is provided.

ChalkProxy also acts as a proxy to the servers so that you can
use a url starting with the server's name.

Features:
 -Supports IE7+, Chrome & Firefox 
 -The registry page is self updating (you don't have to keep pressing refresh)
 -Servers can register arbitrary properties to include in the page (branch/release/hostname)
 -programmatic access to all servers is available at /list
 -/<serverName>/ proxies to the server (but there is no url rewriting)
 
Requirements:
 -Java 6+
 -Linux (although writing a windows start script would probably be easy)
 
Running:
 -git clone https://github.com/thomasrynne/ChalkProxy.git
 -cd ChalkProxy
 -set JAVA_HOME
 -./compile
 -./run --demo-mode start-stop
    This will run ChalkProxy in demo mode so you will see registrations come and go
 -go to http://localhost:8080
 -see About (http://localhost:8080/About) for more information on registering servers
 -use ./start and ./stop to leave it running
