ChalkProxy - manages test web servers

ChalkProxy solves the problem of keeping track of multiple test servers
which run on different machines and/or ports. 

Each server registers with ChalkProxy so that ChalkProxy can show
a list of all servers and ChalkProxy proxies for them so that the
URLs includes a meaningful name for the server you are using.

Features:
 -Supports IE7+, Chrome & Firefox 
 -Chalkboard page is self updating (you don't have to keep pressing refresh)
 -Servers can register arbitrary properties to include in the page (branch/release/user)
 -programmatic access to all servers is available at /list
 -/<serverName>/ proxies to the server
 
Requirements:
 -Java 6+
 -Scala 2.9+
 -Linux (although writing a windows start script would probably be easy)
 
Running:
 -git clone https://github.com/thomasrynne/ChalkProxy.git
 -cd ChalkProxy
 -set JAVA_HOME and SCALA_HOME
 -./compile
 -./run --demo-mode start-stop
    This will run ChalkProxy in demo mode so you will see registrations come and go
 -go to http://localhost:8080
 -see About (http://localhost:8080/About) for more information on registering servers
 -use ./start and ./stop to leave it running

IE & Firefox
 -IE and Firefox auto update support is achieved using a flash plugin which requires access to port 843
 -You need to either
  -Forward port 8430 to 843 using:
      sudo socat TCP-LISTEN:843,fork TCP:localhost:8430
    or
      iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 843 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8430
  -Run ChalkProxy as root and specify the flash port (--flash-port 843)
